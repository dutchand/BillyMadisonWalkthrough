# BillyMadisonWalkthrough
The lab was focused on the Billy Madison exercise which sought to capture the flag: find his 12-grade final exam project. It included following the walkthrough by those who completed the exercise. Students were required to setup the internal network, install the Billy Madison OS on a Virtual Machine, conduct a reconnaissance (foot printing, fingerprinting and enumeration). The scope was limited to the walkthrough as provided by the lab details. The tools and methodology vary based on the student's interest. The attacker machine was Kali, and the target was the Billy Madison.   The Billy Madison system is a project based on the plot that an attacker named Erick Gordon plans to take over the Madison Hotels. To achieve this, he has installed malware on Billy's computer just before the two were set to face off in an academic decathlon. Billy has to regain control of his system and decrypt his 12th grade final project or he will not graduate from high school. If not, he fails, loses the decathlon, and loses succession to head of the Madison Hotels.   The goal of this lab was to follow the g0blin's walkthrough.
